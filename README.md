# Clocks

A little web tool
for designing and understanding
clockwork math.

After downloading the code:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

Currently
this is designed for use
in a local developer environment,
where wheel train components
can be added or removed
directly in the markup.
Maybe someday
it will have a database
and more interactive
component-management.

The initial
[codepen proof of concept](https://codepen.io/miriamsuzanne/pen/mdzMqbm)
was based on the
'Practical Guide to Wooden Wheeled Clock Design'
by [Clayton Boyer](https://lisaboyer.com/Claytonsite/Claytonsite1.htm).
This repo is an attempt
at using Eleventy/webC and web components
to make the tool more flexible
for different clockwork arrangements.
